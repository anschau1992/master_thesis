% Context
% Problem to solve

% What is already done in this area, what is still open?
% Show a work, which is pretty near --> one of the readings
% but also mention the lack it has

\subsection*{The goals of this master's thesis}
% explain what we argue and what we think could be make better
We argue that complement topic extraction from reviews with the capability of cluster similar reviews (assigning them to a well defined task of maintenance/evolution) and
  determining the corresponding parts of source code that need to be maintained/changed (in according to the suggested change tasks),  will concretely help developers planning app improvements and meeting market requirements.

\subsection*{Task description}
%

% TODO write other main tasks
The main tasks of this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read up on the current state of the art in industry and research in the areas relevant to the thesis, including AR-Miner. %TODO: add more areas
\item Write a software program able to gather user reviews and save them into a database.
\item Extend the program, so it is capable to link clustered reviews with the corresponding source code.
\item Writing an academic report summarizing the results from the work on items 1 to 3.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Deliverables}
%
% which are the main phases,
% 1. reading literature, existing tools


%TODO build up milestones
The major milestones of the project are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
When & What \\
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
$1^{\mathit{st}}$ month & State of the Art review is finished. Tools are picked and learned. \\
$2^{\mathit{nd}}$ month & Database is set up and collecting user reviews. \\
$4^{\mathit{rd}}$ month &  Implementation of the Linking is finished. \\
$5^{\mathit{th}}$month & The proof-of-concept implementation is finished.\\
$6^{\mathit{th}}$month & Thesis is written, proof-of-concept is fully functional and delivered.
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Provided resources}

There is no need of special provided resources to realise this thesis

\subsection*{General thesis guidelines}

The typical rules of academic work must be followed. In
\cite{Bernstein:8} Bernstein describes a number of guidelines which
must be followed. At the end of the thesis, a final report has to be
written. The report should clearly be organized, follow the usual academic
report structure, and has to be written in English. As implementing software is also part of this thesis, state-of-the-art
design, coding, and documentation standards for the software have to be obeyed.
